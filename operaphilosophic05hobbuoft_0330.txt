It is said to have been published in 4ιο in 1666 : but the Editor
has met with no copy of this edition.

The ‘⁶ Person of Quality ” seems to have been no great scholar,
and certainly not, as is sometimes supposed, Hobbes himself.
He occasionally mistakes the sense os the Latin: as in the
old woman's tale of her father penetrating into the cavern for
a great distance on the further side of the river 2—-

Huc nobis; ultra nulli licet ire. Nec fas est
Credere narranti vetulae de patre, quod olim etc.

And he translates

Pellaeam imitante sarissam.

“ like to Sal-issa tight.”

There is an English poem called “ The Wonders of the Peak,”
written by Charles Cotton, and first published, as Wood sayS‚
in 1681. But it has no resemblance to the poem of Hobbes.
A copy of the 4th edition of Cotton's poem published in
1694, is to be found in the library of the British Museum.

The Title-page and Advertisement prefixed to the edition of
1678, are given in the two following pages.
