WB are told by Aubrey that Hobbes began this poem some
time before the Restoration.—-“ In 1659”, he says, “ and some
years before, his lord was at Little Salisbury house, (now
turned into the Middle Exchange), where he wrote, amongst
other things, a poeme in Latin Hexameter and Pentameter,
on the Enoroaohment of the Clergie (both Roman and re-
formed) on the civil power. I remember I saw there 500
verses a'nd more. He did read Cruvssmns’ Historia Univer-
salis, and made up his poeme from thence.’' [See Aubrey's
Lise of Hobbes, Lctters from the Bodleian]

The poem may be more truly said to have been made up from
the LEVIATHAN‚ with the help of names and dates from
Cluverius. Some of the most striking passages borrowed
from that work are marked in this edition: and the reader
will find out more for himself.

Hobbes refers to this poem in his VrrA, p. xx. He speaks of it
as having been written circa annum oetatis suoe octayesimmm
and as containing versuum circiter duo millia. He adds,
speaking of the ΒΕΗΕΜΟΤΗ as well as the H1s'r0R1A Eccum-
ASTICA, sed non sinebant tempora ut publicarentur. 'Phe
obstacle to their publication at the period alluded to by
Hobbes, about 1670, existed no longer in 1688; when the
latter work appeared sor the first time.

The preface was written by the compilet of the F OEDERA, Thomas

Rymer of Gray’s Inn: to whom also must be attributed the
title-page and its motto.
