Tms poem, which is represented by our author in his στιγμαὶ,
published in 1657, as having been “ made long since” (see
vol. vii. p. 389), appears to have been written in the interval
between the succession of his first pupil, William Lord
Cavendish, to the title of Earl of Devonshire, and his death,
that is to say, between 1626 and 1628 :—

Sed Dominum, mea Musa, colas, cui gente vetusta
Orto dat titulos Devonia, Derbia curas·

ιιι *2 a

Tum Dominam spectes a:

Amborumque vide sobolem3 imprimisque puellam
Dignam qua caleant Superi, binosque puellos
Angelicos κ ιι

It was probably laid aside, when Hobbes on the death of his
pupil lest the Cavendish family for a while: “nimium neglec-
tus abivit”: (VITA Carm. exp.). And if the date of 1636 is
eorrectly attributed by Anthony Wood to the first edition, it
was published just before his return from abroad in 1637 with
his second pupil, the son of the late Earl.

The only editions that the Editor has met with, are the quarto
edition without date or title-page, which seems to be that to
which Anthony Wood assigns the date of 1636 ε and the oc-
tavo edition os 1678, published by Hobbes’ bookseller‚ Wil-
liam Crook, along with an English translation by “ a Person
os Quality.”
