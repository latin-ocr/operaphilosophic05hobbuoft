“ Tms Latine Poem writ by the famous Mr. Thomas Hobs of
Malmsbury, hath got such a reputation‚ that many English
readers had a great desire to be acquainted with it3 for whose
sakes it is now translated into English, although without the
knowledge of Mr. Hobs; who it is hoped will not be dis-
pleased with this attempt, which is lest to others judgments‚
whether well or ill. Reader, Farewell: but do not forget to
peruse that excellent Translation of Homer by Mr. Hobs. 1
think the most exact and best translation that ere I saw.”
